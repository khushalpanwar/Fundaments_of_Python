What are negative indexes and why are they used?

==>

# Negative indexes in python are a way to access elements from the end of a sequence, such as a string, list or tuple.

# In Python, indexing starts from '0' for the frist element at the beginning of the sequence.

# Negative indexing allows you to count position from the end of the sequence, starting form '-1' for the last element,
    '-2' for the second last element, and so on.




Negative indexing is used to conveniently access the elements from the end of the sequence without needing to know the length 
of the sequence beforehand. They can be particularly when you want to access elements relative to the end of the sequence or 
when you want to iterate over a sequence in reverse.


For example, consider a list my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50].

my_list[-1] will access the last element of the list (50).
my_list[-2] will access the second-to-last element of the list (40).


Negative indexes provide a concise and intuitive way to access elements from the end of a sequence, enhancing the 
readability and maintainability of your code.
